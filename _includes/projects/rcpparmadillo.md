### Rcpp Armadillo

Rcpp connects R with the powerful Armadillo templated C++ library for linear algebra. Armadillo aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of use, and its syntax is deliberately similar to Matlab which makes it easy to port existing code (as shown by an included Kalman Filter example).

More details, documentation, vignettes are at the RcppArmadillo page and in a paper about RcppArmadillo (CSDA, in press)
