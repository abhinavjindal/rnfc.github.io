### Rcpp

Rcpp provides a powerful API on top of R, permitting direct interchange of rich R objects (including S3, S4 or Reference Class objects) between R and C++. Rcpp sugar gives syntactic sugar such as vectorised C++ expression; Rcpp modules provide easy extensibility using declarations and Rcpp attributes greatly facilitates code integration.

More details, documentation, vignettes are at the Rcpp page.
