# Rcpp for Seamless R and C++ Integration

The Rcpp package has become the most widely used language extension for R, the powerful environment and language for computing with data. As of early 2013, over 100 packages on CRAN and a further 10 on BioConductor deploy Rcpp to extend R, to accelerate computations and to connect to other C++ projects. This page provides a few pointers to other popular packages using Rcpp, as well as to a few related external sites. A good introduction to Rcpp is provided by our JSS paper on Rcpp (also included in the package) and the numerous vignettes included in the package.
