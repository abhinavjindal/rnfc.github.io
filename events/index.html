<h2 id="about-the-conference">About the conference</h2>
<hr />

<p>The annual useR! international R User conference is the main meeting of the R user and developer community. Its program consists of both invited and user-contributed presentations:</p>

<p>The invited keynote lectures cover a broad spectrum of topics ranging from technical and R-related computing issues to general statistical topics of current interest.<br />
The user-contributed presentations are submitted as abstracts prior to the conference and may be related to (virtually) any R-related topic. The presentations are typically organized in sessions of either broad or special interest, which also comprise a “free” discussion format. Such a discussion format not only provides a forum for software demonstrations and detailed discussions but also supports the self-organization of the respective communities.<br />

In 2014, the conference will be held at the campus of the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA). The conference is being organized with support from the UCLA Statistics Department, the Foundation for Open Access Statistics and the Los Angeles R user group. The organizing committee consists of:</p>

<p>Chair: David McArthur – UCLA School of Medicine.<br />
Jan de Leeuw – UCLA Department of Statistics<br />
Amelia McNamara – UCLA Department of Statistics<br />
Katharine Mullen – UCLA Department of Statistics<br />
Jeroen Ooms – UCLA Department of Statistics<br />
Szilárd Pafka – Los Angeles R User’s Group<br />
Tim Triche – University of Southern California<br />
Joshua Wiley – UCLA Department of Psychology<br />

<h3 id="john-chambers---interfaces-efficiency-and-big-data">John Chambers - Interfaces, Efficiency and Big Data</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of R continues to grow, notably in the number and diversity of packages that apply R to a wide range of data sources and analytic techniques. At the same time, statistics is currently “hot”, particularly by implication in “data science” and “big data”. In conjunction, these phenomena have stimulated interest in improving the use of R for applications with heavy demands for computation and/or data size. Responding sensibly requires understanding the essential model in R for computation and data; in fact, the key concepts go all the way back to the beginning of S. The challenges have grown enormously, but so have the options and the potential tools. This talk discusses various approaches, using as examples some promising current projects. [slides]</p>

<h3 id="martin-mchler---good-practices-in-r-programming">Martin Mächler - Good Practices in R Programming</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the first useR! meeting in Vienna in 2004, I had presented seven guidelines for good R programming practice I called “rules”. Revisiting, I will ask how much has changed - or not. Namespaces have brought even more justification for emphasizing functions as the main ingredients of much of good R code. We have more and better tools for reproducible research and data analysis nowadays, and I’ll touch on some consequences I see for useR’s code organization. As some of it has been my specialty within R Core, we’ll also look into some aspects of a generalized FAQ 7.31 and what every programmeR should know about computer arithmetic.</p>

<h3 id="dirk-eddelbuettel---r-c-and-rcpp">Dirk Eddelbuettel - R, C++ and Rcpp</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the last few years, Rcpp has become a key tool for extending R with compiled code. In this talk, we start by reviewing the context for using C++ in R. Next, we briefly illustrate both the ease of use, as well as the power of Rcpp. We then assess the growth of Rcpp, before we provide some comments regarding the CRAN package ecosystem which are drawn from both our experience with Rcpp and our experience in providing components of the Debian / Ubuntu packaging system. [slides]</p>

<h3 id="david-diez---textbooks-struggle-where-software-succeeds">David Diez - Textbooks struggle where software succeeds</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of open-source textbooks in the classroom has struggled to keep pace with the adoption of open-source software in research, such as R. There is strong demand for course resources such as textbooks, but adoption of open-source options by instructors has been slow. OpenIntro (openintro.org) has been one of the teams developing an ecosystem of free course resources for introductory statistics. I’ll discuss why open-source in the classroom is different than open-source software; I’ll give the first-ever public look at hard numbers on OpenIntro’s progress (including $$$); and I’ll discuss how to join the open education movement.

<h3 id="karline-soetaert---solving-differential-equations-in-r">Karline Soetaert - Solving differential equations in R</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>R has become the most widely used system for statistical data analysis, but it is also well suited for other disciplines in scientific computing. One of the fields where considerable progress has been made is the numerical solution of differential equations. Differential equations are the mathematical formalism expressing conservation laws of e.g. energy, momentum, mass, and are commonly used in many engineering and scientific disciplines. Several R packages that I (co-)authored: deSolve, rootSolve, bvpSolve and ReacTran, allow to efficiently solve and analyse a large variety of deterministic differential equations. They comprise ordinary differential equations, initial value and boundary value problems, differential algebraic equations, partial differential equations and delay differential equations. In my talk, I will show how differential equation problems can be solved in R, how to deal with numerically challenging problems, how external data can be handled, how results can be plotted, different scenarios compared, …</p>

<h3 id="jan-de-leeuw-and-katharine-mullen---the-journal-of-statistical-software-past-present-future">Jan de Leeuw and Katharine Mullen - The Journal of Statistical Software: Past, Present, Future</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>JSS was established in 1996. Among its original purposes were promoting open access publishing, promoting open source software, and promoting the new UCLA Department of Statistics. In addition we wanted to make it possible for software writers to receive academic credit for their work. From the start we decided on a purely volunteer model, with no financial charges for either authors or readers, and no financial rewards for editors or reviewers. In this presentation we review the history of JSS, the developments in its form and contents, its interaction with the R project, and the real and anticipated problems in its management. [slides]</p>
