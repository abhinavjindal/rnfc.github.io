            <p>The learning objective for this module is to teach HBA students how to build a private-equity quality leveraged buy-out (LBO) model. This will help students to understand how to project necessary financial hurdles for companies recently acquired by private-equity firms in order properly estimate the probability that the investment is a success, and therefore give the best recommendation possible to partners.</p>
            <p>The Dell Leveraged Buyout differs from a typical LBO in several interesting ways, most of which will have seldom been seen by HBA students previously. Microsoft invested in Dell through a $2mm subordinated note, but the level of their participation in the management of Dell was unclear. Michael Dell collaborated with Silver Lake to retain his equity and management position post-merger, which is unusual for a LBO. As discussed, scenarios for revenue and expenses were crucial because Silver Lake was ultimately trying to turn Dell around and needed to focus on growing segments of their business as well as letting go of the non-profitable segments. For Dell to grow to a point where Silver Like could reach the target IRR, many post-transitions acquisitions needed to be undertaken. Students would need to determine if Dell was in a position where these transactions could be successfully completed.</p>
            <p>The main advantage to this LBO framework vs. a typical LBO model is the dynamic nature of the model. The framework was designed to easily change between different operating and financing scenarios. The excel skills learnt through this module can be leveraged in many different applications that an HBA student pursuing a career in the buy or sell side will be able to use every day to streamline their tasks.</p>
            <p>The technical document for the Dell Leveraged Buyout was written so students with basic excel knowledge could easily recreate the model given, and understand both the technical excel implication of a single formula, as well as the financial math behind why a formula is written how it is. This was done to ensure that all students would be able to fully realize the learning opportunities of this case. This introduction to building dynamic models can be leveraged into an endless amount of applications, which can be utilized to help HBA students succeed in their careers.</p>
            <p>I would like to thank James Hammond, Corey Obermayer, Sean Hughes, Josh Heisz, and Michael Schwartz for their excellent research assistance.</p>
