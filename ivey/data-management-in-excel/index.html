			<h4>Financial Data</h4>
			<hr class="darker short-left">
			<p>The VBA algorithm that aggregates historical financial statements and key statistics in batches. Nico wrote this algorithms almost 10 years ago and it is part of the Ivey AddIns. This year Jonathon Barbaro wrote a technical report explaining the fast hash table class Nico wrote for Excel to index VBA objects, which is the optimal function for VBA. This class has also helped students to understand high-dimensional Euclidean space, Cartesian products of continuous quantities, and how to manipulate data using algebraic operations.</p>

			<h4>Operating Model</h4>
			<hr class="darker short-left">
			<p>Michael Schwartz and Nico designed, coded and optimized a dynamic framework to sanitize and forecast financial statements of public companies, based on the algorithm in the Financial Section. They also incorporated a rational exponential polynomial capable to generate non-linear growth; allowing students to understand how with multiple parameters they can fit an elephant, and make him wiggle his trunk. Feel free to refer to presentation folder. Michael and Jorge Alvarez also wrote an excellent technical report explaining formulations in the spreadsheets.</p>

			<h4>LBO Model</h4>
			<hr class="darker short-left">
			<p>James Hammond, Chris Voorpostel, Sean Hughes, and Josh Heisz worked with Nico on the Dell LBO Case. Nico is currently working on the technical report that explains in detail all of the formulations and circularity. It is fair to say that most, if not all of the top students in class have found their way into excellent jobs in Finance.</p>

			<h4>Infrastructure Model</h4>
			<hr class="darker short-left">
			<p>Tanuj Dutta, Sam Archivald, Corey Obermayer and Kevin Good worked with Nico on the framework for infrastructure modelling. The idea was to teach students how to incorporate mathematical equations to corporate finance models. They wrote a very lengthy technical report indexing and explaining all of the formulations in the framework.</p>
