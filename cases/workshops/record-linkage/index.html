<p>Reclin functions work with data sets in <code>ldat</code> format. <code>ldat</code> is a package that makes it easy to work with large datasets in R because it is able to process data by chunk in memory.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- as.ldat(x)
y &lt;- as.ldat(y)</code></pre>
<p><code>ldat</code> objects resemble a list object, except that they are stored as external pointers.</p>

<h1>Record Linkage</h1>
<div id="generate-pairs" class="section level2">
<h2>Generate pairs</h2>
<p>The first step to record linkage is to generate the list of record pairs to be compared and tested for linkage. In reclin, this can be done using the <code>simple_blocking</code> function. This function uses the function <code>gen_pairs</code> internally to create a <code>ldat</code> object with two columns, which indicate the index of the record in <code>x</code> and the index of of the record in <code>y</code> that comprise of each pair.</p>
<p>If blocking is implemented, only pairs that adhere to the blocking criteria will be generated.</p>
<div id="how-gen_pairs-work" class="section level3">
<h3>How <code>gen_pairs</code> work:</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>if no blocking variable is provided, the function simply returns the indices of the record pairs based on all combinations. For example, if <code>x</code> contains 1000 records and <code>y</code> contains 500 records, <code>gen_pairs</code> will return 500,000 pairs to be compared. This is done through an <code>expand.grid</code> function.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Here’s an example of <code>expand.grid</code>; the output numbers in the example are equivalent to row indices for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>:</li>
</ul>

<h3>How <code>simple_blocking</code> works:</h3>
<p>The function facilitates blocking and calls <code>gen_pairs</code> internally. <code>block_x</code> and <code>block_y</code> parameters take in character vectors of variable names: the names provided in <code>block_x</code> will be used to match variables in <code>x</code> to variables in <code>y</code> which is based on <code>block_y</code>. The corresponding variables from <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> must be positionally matched, regardless of the actual variable name.</p>
<p>The function calls <code>gen_pairs</code> for each blocking variable and appends the results together. If <code>blocktype = &quot;or&quot;</code>, the blocking is based on agreement on one or more block variables. This means that providing more blocking variables relaxes the criteria and produces more pairs; any pair that match on at least one of the provided blocking variables will be included. If <code>blocktype = &quot;and&quot;</code>, all blocking variables must agree for a record pair to be included.</p>
<p>The function returns an ordered object of all unique record pairs by indices.</p>
<p>We can see an example of the blocking here:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rpairs &lt;- simple_blocking(x, y, block_x = c(&quot;state&quot;), block_y = c(&quot;state&quot;))

<h2>Create a link object</h2>
<p>The <code>link</code> function is the main function that we will actually use in practice. It calls the <code>simple_blocking</code> function (default) and creates a <code>link</code> object, which contains both the original data and the paired data. Note that <code>simple_blocking</code> is an argument to the function, and alternative blocking functions/methods can be used as long as the output format stays the same.</p>
<p><code>link</code> takes the arguments <code>by_x</code> and <code>by_y</code> to specify the variables that should be used in performing linkage. These parameters work the same way as <code>block_x</code> and <code>block_y</code> mentioned in <code>simple_blocking</code> where variable names must be positionally matched.</p>
<p><code>link</code> takes the row indices generated by <code>simple_blocking</code> and creates a comparison table for each record pair. The default comparison is exact, where if a variable value is identical between the record pair, it is given a comparison score of 1, and otherwise 0. <code>link</code> also supports string distance comparisons where the scores are continuous between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>For string distance comparisons, we can provide either a single function, in which case it will be applied to all variables, or a separate function for each variable. In order to apply different string distance algorithms to different variables, we can either provide a named vector of the variables of interest, with the names being the corresponding variable names to apply the function to, or an unamed vector of length <code>by_x</code> that is positionally matched to <code>by_x</code>.</p>
<p>For a list of string distance algorithms provided, see function <code>similarity</code>.</p>
<p><em>Note: The names should be matched to <code>by_x</code> for situations where <code>by_x</code> differ from <code>by_y</code>.</em></p>
<p>Here’s an example of the argument to the <code>link</code> function for string comparison:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>comparator.funcs &lt;- c(first_name = similarity_fun(method=&quot;jw&quot;),
                      last_name = similarity_fun(method=&quot;jw&quot;),
                      SSN = similarity_fun(method=&quot;lcs&quot;),
                      med_number = similarity_fun(method=&quot;lcs&quot;),
                      city = similarity_fun(method=&quot;jw&quot;),
                      address = similarity_fun(method=&quot;jw&quot;),
                      zip = similarity_fun(method=&quot;osa&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>The <code>method = &quot;&quot;</code> parameter specifies the string distance algorithm used. Also, additional arguments to similarity functions can be passed through <code>similarity_fun</code>.</p>
<p><code>link</code> calls the <code>bcomp</code> function to create comparison patterns. <code>bcomp</code> will call the corresponding string distance algorithm for each variable for each record pair. The resulting comparison table is saved in <code>link$pairs</code>.</p>
<p>Example using <code>link</code>, with the result being an object of class <code>link</code>. The <code>link</code> object includes the original data sets as well as the new output generated from the function in a list format:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>vars &lt;- setdiff(names(x), &quot;id&quot;)
rpairs &lt;- link(x, y, by_x = vars, by_y = vars, pairs_generator = simple_blocking,
                comparator = comparator.funcs, progress = F)</code></pre>

<h2>Estimate m- and u-probabilities</h2>
<p>Before probabilistic weights can be calculated, we must first estimate <code>m</code> (probability of true link on agreement), <code>u</code> (probability of true non-link on agreement), and <code>p</code> (percentage of true links). This is done through the <code>simple_em</code> function, which uses the <em>EM algorithm</em>.</p>
<p>Currently this algorithm does not directly support similarity scores, so we need to provide threshold levels to convert any such scores into binary scores <em>(0 or 1)</em>. If the thresholds are not provided, it defaults to 0.999. The implication here is that if string distance algorithms are used but no corresponding thresholds are provided, we would not be able to get the desirable effect in the model.</p>

<p><code>count_patterns</code> will also keep the unique comparison patterns and summarise by the number of times it has been represented in the data set. This will be used in the EM algorithm.</p>

<p>With this method of probabilistic linkage, we must be able to select an appropriate threshold that separates links from non-links. If a record pair has a weight above the threshold, it will be classified as a link. The reclin package offers tools for manual decision making for this threshold, which is done by reviewing the record pairs around certain weight thresholds to determine if they are true links.</p>
<p>In order to determine a starting point for manually reviewing pairs, we can use the <code>weight_dist</code> function. The parameter <code>nbreak</code> controls how many weight brackets the pairs are divided into.</p>
<p>Generally, the weight distribution follows a U-shape with the majority of the record pairs falling into the lowest weight brackets. This is expected as two data sets with 1000 records each will generate 1000,000 record pairs without blocking, but will only have at most 1000 true links. There will be a number of record pairs in the highest weight brackets that are the most probable links. We want to start by examining the lowest points in this U-shape since we want to find the tipping point in the weight distribution that separates the links from the non-links. Higher <code>nbreak</code> is especially useful where there is a large number of record pairs as it offers more precise estimates of weight brackets with the fewest observations.</p>

<h2>Selecting thresholds</h2>
<p>To facilitate the manual review of pairs around a threshold, we use the <code>dump_pairs</code> function. For efficiency purposes, this function returns a function that contains all the data in the link input object ordered by weight.</p>
<p>The function returned by <code>dump_pairs</code> has two arguments. The first argument (<code>threshold</code>) is the weight threshold around which the pairs are returned. With the optional second argument <code>n</code>, we can specify the number of pairs above and below this threshold the should be returned.</p>

<h2>Classify pairs</h2>
<p>Once we have decided on one or two thresholds, we need to classify the record pairs. This is done using the <code>classify</code> function.</p>
<p>When one threshold is given, record pairs above the threshold are classified as links and pairs below the threshold are classified as non-links. Links are indicated by a <code>class</code> of 2 and non-links are indicated by 0. When two thresholds are given, pairs with weights between the two thresholds are classified as possible links, indicated by a <code>class</code> of 1.</p>

</div>
<div id="n-to-m-matching" class="section level2">
<h2>N to M matching</h2>
<p><code>n_to_m</code> function allows us to take a classified object and force n-to-m matching.</p>
<p>The function requires the package lpSolve:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;lpSolve&quot;)
library(lpSolve)</code></pre>
<p>The function takes integer values for the parameters <code>n</code> and <code>m</code>. Each element of <code>x</code> can be linked to at most <code>n</code> elements of <code>y</code>, and each element of <code>y</code> can be linked to at most <code>m</code> elements of <code>x</code>. Matches are selected to maximize the overall weight. The default values are <code>n = 1</code> and <code>m = 1</code>, which means 1-to-1 matching.</p>
<p>In this example, we set <code>n = 2</code> and <code>m = 1</code>. This means that it is possible for a record from the master data set <code>x</code> to be linked to a maximum of 2 records from the batch data set <code>y</code>, but each record from <code>y</code> can only be linked to one record from <code>x</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lclass &lt;- n_to_m(lclass, n = 2, m = 1)</code></pre>
<p>When we have unique identifiers for the records, we can append the identities to each pair in the link object in order to get the true match status.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lclass &lt;- set_true_match_id(lclass, id_x = 'id', id_y = 'id')</code></pre>
<p>To view the performance of the linkage, we can create a confusion matrix:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>confusion_matrix(lclass)</code></pre>
<pre><code>      Non-Links Possible Links Links
True     149260              0   240

</div>
<div id="displaying-result" class="section level2">
<h2>Displaying result</h2>
<p>There are a few ways to display the linkage result:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>matches</code> <code>matches</code> is a function that allows us to extract matches for class 0, 1, 2 or &gt;0. The result is a data frame with the original row indices for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> for record pairs within the specified class.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>matches &lt;- matches(lclass, class = 2)
head(matches)</code></pre>
<pre><code>    x y
1  64 2
2 242 3
3  35 4
4  25 5
5 430 6
6 169 7</code></pre>
<p>2 <code>true_matches</code> the function <code>true_matches</code> can be used when <code>set_true_match_id</code> has been implemented. <code>true_matches</code> returns the indices of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> where the true match status is <code>TRUE</code>. This can potentially help us examine the weights calculated on true matches to investigate ways to improve the algorithm.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>link_result</code> <code>link_result</code> displays record pairs within a specified class in pairwise fashion and with original information. Each pair is separated by a blank row (a row of NAs). This makes it easy to visually adjudicate the record pairs to see if the classification is accurate.</li>
</ol>
<p>The class parameter defaults to <code>class &gt; 0</code>, and can be specified by values 0, 1, or 2.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>linkresult &lt;- link_result(lclass, class = 2)

<p>There is also an experimental feature for <code>link_result</code>, which is set through the parameter <code>consolidated = T</code>. The <code>consolidated</code> parameter controls the output display format for one-to-many matches. <code>consolidated = T</code> assumes that <code>x</code> is the master data and displays all <code>y</code> records that link to the same <code>x</code> record in one group. Each group is separated by an empty row. If <code>consolidated = F</code>, data is displayed in pairwise groups as described above.</p>
