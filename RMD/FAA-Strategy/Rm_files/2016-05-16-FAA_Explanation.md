title: "Flexible Asset Allocation Strategy"
---


# Strategy Explanation

This strategy extends the timeseries momentum (or trendfollowing) model towards a generalized momentum model, called Flexible Asset Allocation (FAA). This is done by adding new momentum factors to the traditional momentum factor (R) based on the relative returns among assets. These new factors are called Absolute momentum (A), Volatility momentum (V) and Correlation momentum (C).

Each asset is ranked on each of the four factors R, A, V and C. By using a linearised representation of a loss function representing risk/return, we are able to arrive at simple closed form solutions for our flexible asset allocation strategy based on these four factors. 

The strategy is based on monthly re-balancing, signal is generated one day before the month end, and execution is done at the market close on the month end.
